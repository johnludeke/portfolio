# Portfolio
### Overview
This repository is the codebase of my personal portfolio, which hosts information you would normally find on a resume. It is intended to be both professional, but also have fun features (such as connectivity to Spotify, showing what I'm listening to live as well as my top songs). This was the first project that I deployed myself as well. My main focus was to keep things simple and focus on good design and implementation.

### Use
This site was hosted using AWS at [johnludeke.com](https://johnludeke.com).

To run the project on your own device, first clone the repository. Then run:
```
npm i
npm start
```

### Future
I cannot see myself sticking with the same portfolio for more than a couple years, but for now I will likely make incremental changes. In addition, as my job / project history updates, so will the site.
